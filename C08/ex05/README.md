# Exercise 05:
	• Turn-in directory : ex05/
	• Files to turn in  : ft_strs_to_tab.c
	• Allowed functions : malloc, free
# Subject:
	• Create a function that displays the content of the array created by the
		previous function.
	• Here’s how it should be prototyped:
		void ft_show_tab(struct s_stock_str *par)
	• The structure will be the same as the previous exercise and will be
		defined in the ft_stock_str.h file
	• For each element, we’ll display:
		• the string followed by a ’\n’
		• the size followed by a ’\n’
		• the copy of the string (that could have been modified) followed
			by a ’\n’
	• We’ll test your function with our ft_strs_to_tab (previous exercise).
		Make it work according to this !
